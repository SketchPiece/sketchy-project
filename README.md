# Sketchy Project

Welcome to the Sketchy Project, my personal endeavor created for a KPU university web development class. This web application, built with Astro, is a testament to my growth and skills in web development. It features a blog where I share my experiences, insights about the classes I've taken at the university, and a section dedicated to information about myself.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, please visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions to download and install it.

### Installation and Running

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the Sketchy Project repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sketchy-project.git
   cd sketchy-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Once you have cloned the repository and navigated into its directory, install the required Node.js packages.

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Project**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the project.

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the Astro server. You can now view the application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
