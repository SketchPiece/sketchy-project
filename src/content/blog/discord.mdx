Discord is a messaging app that's very popular among online communities and gamers. It was initially developed for chat and voice calls, but now evolved into useful tool anyone looking to connect, communicate, and collaborate in virtual spaces. In this post I want to analyze the demographics, geographics, and psychographics aspects of the Discord audience.

Demographics of the Discord's primary audience is likely to be young and tech-savvy people that may include both male and female genders, but is likely to have a more of male users. The majority of Discord's users are probably between the ages of 18 and 35. The secondary Discord's audience could be also educational institutions students and universities that are ready to communicate with their community through a relatively new way.

Geographics of the Discord's audience is probably to be spread worldwide, but with a higher concentration in contries with good internet speed and larger population of gamers.

There's a little more to say about the psychographics of the Discord audience. It's more likely to be people who are passionate about gaming and interested in connecting with other gamers and communities. This audience may value humor, authenticity, and creativity, and appreciate a brand that understands and caters to their interests. Discord's quirky and at times, goofy, social media content is likely to resonate with this audience, as it helps to create a sense of community and shared experiences. The posts themselves can be relatively serious and describe some news of the Discord community and innovations in the platform.

Or they may make no sense at all and just be funny. Discord is, in my memory, one of the largest corporations that takes its promotions "especially seriously".

Overall, a youthful and varied audience of gamers that value comedy, originality, and authenticity in the brands they choose to engage with is likely to find Discord's social media profile appealing.
