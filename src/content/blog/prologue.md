Hello internet, my name is Andrew! I am a web developer from Ukraine who recently moved to Canada to study at KPU university. I have a strong interest in technology, particularly blockchain, artificial intelligence, and software development. Every day I study what new is happening in the world and what amazing technologies humanity has invented. I believe time we are living now is the best time to be alive!

Throughout my career I have gained development experience and worked on a variety of projects. I am constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to develop my knowledge and skills. I believe that studying in Canada will allow me to learn from the best in the industry and gain a unique perspective on the field. Who knows, maybe someday I would be part of the core team in some compony like Google or Apple who drive the progress.

In my free time, I enjoy a wide variety of activities. Despite my interest in technology, I am also a big music fan, and I used to be in a rock band with some friends back in Ukraine. I also enjoy puzzles and have a talent for solving Rubik's Cubes. In fact, I can solve it in 40 seconds, which I think is pretty impressive!

I am thrilled to be studying at KPU and immersing myself in the local tech community. I'm looking forward to learning from my classmates and professors, as well as networking with industry professionals.
